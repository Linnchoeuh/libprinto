# printo

> You must add the -lprinto flag at compilation.

It's not that useful because printf exist but I made it because printf is forbidden in my school. 

## Features

This lib has to major function : **printo()** and  **generate_str()**

- This function is able to print: 
  - int/long (%d)
  - float/double (%f)
  - pointer (%p)
  - char (%c)
  - str (%s)
  - boolean (%B)

The usage is very similar to printf, but you also have to give at first parameter the output (where you want to write it)
